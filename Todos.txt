1. no thread div on index route?
2. somehow doesn't seem to be getting all threads?? (test this somehow?)
3. right now I am ignoring "thread_broadcasts", where a user replies to something and also shares it to the channel.  I am just treating them like normal replies, and not showing the messages as root_messages (whereas they are treated as root messages in the real slack app)
4.make it so that note hides or unhides the relevant thread, rather than refreshing the page

5. improve styling
