1. no thread div on index route?
2. somehow doesn't seem to be getting all threads
3. keep thread thing and channel list as fixed or absolute
4. right now I am ignoring "thread_broadcasts", where a user replies to something and also shares it to the channel.  I am just treating them like normal replies, and not showing the messages as root_messages (whereas they are treated as root messages in the real slack app)


NEXT:
put a note with how many replies there are under each message with replies
make it so that note hides or unhides the relevant thread
